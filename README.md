- Technique of keeping internal state of object hidden from the outside.
- Achieved usung private attributes and providing public methods to access and update them.
- Syntax: __varname

## Abstraction

- Concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

- Parent Class: The class from where the features are inherited from.
- Child Class: The class that inherits the features.
- Benefits: Classes are created easily, easy maintenance.

## Polymorphism
[Polymorphism code](polymorphism.py)
- Ability to present the same interface for different data types.
- Allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon
